===========
same normal mode experience for colemak user. like qwerty

for 'colemak' user, you will be confused when you enter the 'normal' mode. because of position of short cuts are changed for 'colemak' keyboard layout. for example, if you want to move down follow the "HJKL" it wasn't work. because of "j"key now "y" positinon in colemak layout. so "j" key now active "n" key function.
 
if you want to use colemak for only typing not normal mode. this plugin might help.
