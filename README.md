Qwerty normal mod key layout for Colemak
===========
For Colemak users, you may be confused when entering normal mode because the positions of the shortcuts have been changed for the Colemak keyboard layout. 

For example, if you try to move down using the "HJKL" keys in normal mode, it will not work because the "J" key is now in the "Y" position in the Colemak layout. This means that the "J" key now performs the function of the "N" key. If you only want to use Colemak for typing and not in normal mode, this plugin may be helpful. 
It will bind the Colemak keys in both normal and visual mode, allowing you to maintain your finger muscle memory as if you were using a QWERTY keyboard.
